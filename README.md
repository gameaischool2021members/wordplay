# wordplay

We created a random map generator that created over 55 thousand random layouts. These layouts was then feeded into a NN to make semantic annotations. We are going to create dungeons out of natural language by asking the NN to create dungeons with specific room nubers and/or differnt difficulty levels.

We also added some gameplay mechanics, simple enemy behaviours and some 3D asstes in order to use those generated maps in a mini dungeon crawler game.
